Wow twitchemotes addon but more addons cause im cooler

Steps:
1. While still in the github press the TwitchEmotes.zip folder, that should open a new page, top right of the page you should have a download button, press it.
2. Drag into your World of Warcraft_retail_\Interface\AddOns folder (the folder inside the zip not the actual zip), if you already have the original addon you do replace with existing files

Ill try to keep uploading more emotes i find funny if you have any suggestions ig just msg me or something idk
